# Selection_strength_evolvability
Selection enhances protein evolvability by increasing mutational robustness and foldability


The scripts in the folder "2020sel_Scripts" were used for SMRT sequencing data analysis in the manuscript titled 'Selection enhances protein evolvability by increasing mutational robustness and foldability'. The SMRT sequencing data are in the folder "SMRT_seq".

All files in the folder "2020sel_Scripts" are python scripts (Python 2.7.12). Please first install python 2.7.x on your computer to execute these programs. An example for executing programs below (via the terminal of ubuntu 16.04LTS system):
